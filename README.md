Scotch Whisky Recommendation System

Clustering Distilleries based on Geographic Distances, Flavour Profiles and feature engineered User Preferences

Motivation: To assist amateur and aspiring whisky afficionados choose their next whisky.

The Idea: Group distilleries based on their flavor profiles (obvious), proximity (natural factors may affect flavor), and reddit user preferences (if many users liked Distil A and C , but hated B and vice versa, there is probably a relationship there), generated through individual ratings of multiple distilleries.

Result: Two rounds of Hierarchy Clustering based on various features and distances that generated clusters to recommend the distillery for your next bottle of Scotch. You can interact with the visual at the interactive html map.

To test it out, download final_cluster.pkl and recommender_fn.py, which you can use to help select your next bottle.
